# Logistic_Regression
Logistic Regression is much similar to the Linear Regression except that how they
are used. Linear Regression is used for solving Regression problems, whereas
Logistic regression is used for solving the classification problems.

Steps in Logistic Regression:
To implement the Logistic Regression using Python, we will use the same steps as
we have done in previous topics of Regression. Below are the steps:

1. Data Pre-processing step
2 .Fitting Logistic Regression to the Training set
3. Predicting the test result
4. Test accuracy of the result(Creation of Confusion matrix)
5 . Visualizing the test set result.
